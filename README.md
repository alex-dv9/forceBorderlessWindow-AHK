AutoHotKey 1.1 is required to run this script.

How to use:
1. On line 3, enter the name(s) of your game(s). Use AutoHotKey’s Window Spy tool to find the exact window name.
2. On line 14, enter your monitor’s width and height plus 14 (default is set for 1920x1080).
3. Run the script and then start your game.

You’ll hear three beeps:
1. First beep: Game detected, script will launch your game.
2. Second beep (after 10 seconds): Game window size and style adjusted.
3. Third beep: Supported game was closed.
